# üß† LangChain SQL Query Assistant

This project is an AI-powered assistant that translates natural language questions into SQL queries, executes them on a MySQL database, and returns human-readable answers. It leverages LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, Chroma vector store, and Mistral AI for language modeling.

# üìå Features

Natural Language to SQL: Converts user questions into syntactically correct SQL queries.

Database Interaction: Connects to a MySQL database to execute generated queries.

Semantic Similarity: Utilizes HuggingFace embeddings and Chroma to select relevant examples for few-shot learning.

Dynamic Prompting: Constructs prompts dynamically using LangChain's FewShotPromptTemplate.

Structured Workflow: Employs LangGraph to orchestrate the workflow in defined steps.
